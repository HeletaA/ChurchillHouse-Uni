                <img src="assets/images/b61714c01df011e49f9f97e2b8540f0f_author.jpg" alt="image of robin boyd"
                    class="imagetwo">

                <p>In 1953 Robin Boyd, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Grounds">Roy Grounds</a> and <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Romberg">Frederick Romberg</a> formed the practice
                    of
                    Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also
                    practiced extensively in Canberra.</p>



                <p>Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design unity.
                    Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm
                    developed a
                    corporate style, combining the philosophies of the trio and representing the advanced thinking of
                    that
                    era. They often worked or supervised on each other’s projects. Their work was a distinctive
                    Australian
                    form of the <em> International Style, then called Contemporary. (Clerehan, 1993) </em></p>



                <p>Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (NCPC) in January 1968 as one of two
                    architectural
                    experts, the other being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Stephenson">Professor Gordon
                        Stephenson</a> from Western Australia. Boyd and Stephenson were charged with creating a
                    statement of
                    civic design philosophy that would form the basis of the NCDC policies relating to the Buildings
                    (Design
                    and Siting) Ordinance 1964. These policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and
                    layout
                    of buildings in the National Capital areas of Canberra.</p>

                <p>Boyd had a prolific output of architectural designs, books and articles. He wrote over 700 articles
                    for
                    journals and newspapers, presented a TV series on Modernism and was the author of Victorian Modern:
                    111
                    Years of modern Architecture in the State of Victoria Australia (1947); Australia’s Home: Its
                    Origins,Builders and Occupiers (1952); The Australian Ugliness (1960); Kenzo Tange (1962); The Walls
                    Around Us: The Story of Australian Architecture (1962);The Puzzle of Architecture (1965); New
                    Directions
                    in Japanese Architecture (1968); Living In Australia (1970); and The Great Australian Drem.</p>

                <p>His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. He was known for his ability
                    to
                    design houses that would meet client needs, solve site problems and still retain architectural
                    integrity. The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and international styles of
                    architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light, simple and elegant and
                    unmistakably modern. (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995).</p>

                <h3>Boyd’s residential designs that are registered on the ACT Heritage Register include:</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>Manning Clark’s House, 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest (1952); </li>
                    <li>Fenner House, 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1953); and </li>
                    <li>Eltringham House, 12 Marawa Place, Aranda (1968-69).</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>He is also credited with the following designs in the ACT:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dr Hilary Roche House, Bedford Street, Deakin (1954); </li>
                    <li>Zoology building ANU (1961); </li>
                    <li>three houses in Vasey Crescent, Campbell (1961) (Grounds & Boyd); </li>
                    <li>W G Verge House, 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1963); </li>
                    <li>204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1964); and </li>
                    <li>Zoology Building ANU (1963-8). </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the 1960s he started to move away from the glass box functionalism of the International and
                    Melbourne
                    Regional styles arguing that it had a limited range of expression and instead tried, somewhat
                    unsuccessfully, to land large prestigious commissions for advanced high-rise buildings. He submitted
                    many designs, but few were successful. Those that he did win tended to be of a more moderate size,
                    such
                    as the Menzies College at La Trobe University or Churchill House. Taylor (1990:80) notes that Boyd’s
                    interest in Brutalism was heavily influenced by his travels in Japan and he became known as the
                    chief
                    advocate in Australia for the “vigorous, concrete buildings of post-war Japan”, but goes on to note
                    that
                    his own attempts at major Brutalist designs show “...a somewhat crude, unexpressive, Brutalist
                    aesthetic.</p>

                <p>Boyd’s later buildings are disappointing...”. Commentary in architectural journals and works on Boyd
                    focus on his residential designs and larger Melbourne-based buildings. References to Churchill House
                    mention that he was working on it at the time of his death, and the most favourable account comes
                    from
                    Serle’s 1995 biography that noted that it was the “only new work of any consequence” (p.308) and
                    that
                    tenders for “Boyd’s innovative design for Churchill House were surprisingly low” (p.309). Raisebeck
                    (2017) noted that, “...Boyd’s works and writings from 1960- 1967 depict a relatively consistent
                    commitment to a universal modernism tempered through a regional lense...exemplified in the earlier
                    Zoology building”, while his later work demonstrates a stark change of focus and a less coherent
                    whole
                    with the different façades of Churchill House showing a different compositional treatment as a
                    result
                    of “...Boyd’s experimental bent and abandonment of an integrated and universal modernism.”</p>

                <p>Boyd received the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1969 and was awarded a
                    Commander
                    of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1971 for his services to architecture and
                    government. In the same year he died suddenly from a stroke while recovering from an anaesthetic as
                    part
                    of treatment for an infection. As a result, his work on the Former Churchill House had to be
                    completed
                    by another architect, Bill Williams, who had been employed by Boyd to work on the project under the
                    supervision of a more experienced architect, Neil Clerehan (who later designed the second storey of
                    the
                    north wing to replace the glass display pavilion). (Serle 1995)</p>

                <h1>The Churchill House</h1>

                <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston
                    Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was
                    Boyd’s
                    last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger
                    designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

                <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate
                    north
                    wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with
                    the
                    north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys
                    high
                    with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two
                    storeyed.
                </p>

                <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features
                    of
                    the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural
                    fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical
                    slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major
                    Canberra
                    buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court
                    of
                    Australia.</p>

                <p>Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began
                    consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In
                    1969
                    it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect
                    Robin
                    Boyd to design the building. The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was
                    to
                    provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the
                    Trust.

                <h3>Features of the original design included:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on
                        the
                        work of the Trust;</li>
                    <li>the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and
                    </li>
                    <li>accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and
                        kitchen.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972.</p>

                <p>Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site
                    representative
                    to replace Boyd. Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect. Boyd was a
                    member of
                    a prominent artistic family, and combined a career as an architect, author and critic (Clerehan
                    1993).
                    He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and deeply interested in the development of
                    Australian architecture. Boyd is often remembered best for his domestic architecture, as well as his
                    books, but he also produced designs for larger scale works, such as in the case of Churchill House.
                    Boyd
                    was awarded the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow in 1970. Boyd was
                    strongly
                    influenced later in his career by the post-war concrete architecture produced in Japan (Taylor
                    1990:80).
                    This Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College Student Housing (1968) and in the
                    design for Churchill House. In this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects, although
                    with
                    only limited success. During the 1990s(?) the glass pavilion was replaced by the current north wing.

                <h3>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century
                    Brutalist style. These include:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>National Gallery of Australia, 1971;</li>
                    <li>Cameron Offices, 1976;</li>
                    <li>Canberra School of Music, 1976; and</li>
                    <li>High Court of Australia, 1980.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office
                    building.
                    While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both
                    office
                    buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were
                    intended
                    to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.</p>

                <p>Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in
                    1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late
                    Twentieth-Century
                    Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.</p>

                <p>The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its east and south wings, the
                    separate north wing or pavilion, the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape
                    in
                    plan, and with the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool is located.
                    The
                    main building is of three storeys with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner, the north
                    wing
                    is of two storeys, and the carpark is two storeyed.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Main Building</h2>

                <p>The main building displays several different elevational treatments. The elevations facing onto the
                    pool
                    area feature floor to ceiling glass with minimal black metal frames to the lowest level, and precast
                    vertical panels on the upper two storeys. Each panel has a projecting fin and are relatively narrow,
                    with the overall affect being of closely spaced vertical fins. Beside the fins are narrow, slot
                    windows
                    providing minimal outlook onto the pool area.</p>

                <p>The south and east elevations are quite different in character having long horizontal sections of
                    flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black metal frames, with timber-textured off-form concrete
                    spandrels between storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section black-coated steel
                    beam.
                    Several window-mounted airconditioners are located on the south elevation. The blank end walls of
                    the
                    wings and the lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete with incised storey lines. At the
                    junction of the two wings are the foyers for each floor as well as the service core including the
                    lift.
                    Apart from the off-form concrete walls of the service elements, the foyers feature glazing set in
                    black
                    metal frames which extends the full height of the building. At the ground floor level the glazing is
                    vertical but above that for the remaining two storeys it is sloping.</p>

                <p>The building has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or finished in slate. Some interior
                    walls
                    are textured, off-form concrete similar to the exterior. Other walls are lightweight partitions.
                    There
                    is a mixture of ceiling treatments: off-form concrete, suspended ceilings and set plasterboard. Many
                    of
                    the interior fitouts appear relatively modern and are not original.The roof of the main building is
                    set
                    behind a parapet and appears to be graded concrete with a membrane coating.</p>

                <h2>North Wing</h2>

                <p>The north wing replaces an earlier pavilion on the same location. The current wing is a two storey
                    structure with a flat metal deck roof set behind a parapet. The wing has an encircling steel
                    colonnade
                    which supports the roof and parapet. The walls are set back from the colonnade and feature
                    flush-mounted
                    glazing set in thin black metal frames, with textured off-form concrete spandrels, similar to the
                    south
                    wall of the south wing. There is an enclosed link between the north and east wings at the ground
                    floor
                    level.</p>


                <h2>Pool Area, Carpark and Landscaping</h2>

                <p>The pool area is lower than the surrounding site, and being mostly enclosed by the wings, has the
                    quality
                    of a sunken courtyard. The pool area is reached by a large flight of concrete steps from the west,
                    and
                    features a pond which borders a large, raised central island which is reached from one side by a set
                    of
                    bridging steps. The island has concrete paving, garden beds and silver birch trees, and is the
                    location
                    for a large fibreglass statue of Sir Winston Churchill.</p>

                    <figcaption>Floor Plan Churchill House</figcaption>
-->

                <p>The carpark is constructed in off-form concrete, with walls displaying the texture of the timber
                    formwork.
                <p>

                <p>Churchill House has a number of landscape/garden areas. At the front (west) of the building is an
                    open
                    lawn area and either side are mixed native/exotic plantings. The pool area contains numerous trees
                    and
                    shrubs, again of mixed native/exotic species. A small courtyard to the southeast of the main
                    building
                    features bamboo.</p>

                <h2>Stylistic Analysis</h2>


                <h3>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as
                    follows:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and
                        east
                        wings.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style:</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner
                        between the east and south wings.</li>
                    <li> Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool
                        area.
                    </li>
                    <li>Precast fins for sun protection, as above.</li>
                    <li>Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. A number of changes have been made
                    which
                    diminish its integrity including:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>the replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, albeit with a
                        sympathetic design;</li>
                    <li>the non-original window-mounted airconditioners which detract from the south elevation;</li>
                    <li>many of the interior fitouts appear to have been modernised; and</li>
                    <li>there are a number of non-original surface mounted conduits internally.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original design.</p>

                <h1>The House Today</h1>
                <h3>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying
                    several key features as follows:</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and
                        east
                        wings.</li>
                    <li>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping
                        structural
                        fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and
                        vertical
                        slit windows.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display
                    a
                    restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the
                    intended
                    office use. The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their
                    understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles. Churchill House has interest for its
                    association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
